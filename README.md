Hello,   

My name is Leon Aaron and I am a highly motivated Computer Science student at UNC Chapel Hill. 

Participating in my middle schoolâ€™s robotics club as a 6th grader was an experience that sparked my creative passion for coding.    

Since then, I have gained proficeincy in both Java and Python and have constructed interesting programming projects to reinforce my computer science skills.   

I am a hard worker who strives for high-quality results and prioritizes clean, organized code.
